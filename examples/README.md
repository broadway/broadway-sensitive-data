Handling sensitive data
=======================

A small example of an implementation of a small domain model. The example
consists of three files. The first file `HandlingSensitiveData` contains the implementation of
the domain model. The second file `HandlingSensitiveDataTest` contains a PHPUnit test suite
demonstrating the handling of sensitive data.

The files contain comments about what is happening.

The PHPUnit tests can be run by changing to this directory and running:

```bash
$ phpunit .
PHPUnit 5.6.2 by Sebastian Bergmann.

.

Time: 22 ms, Memory: 4.00Mb

OK (1 tests, 2 assertions)
```
